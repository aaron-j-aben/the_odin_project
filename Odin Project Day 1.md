# Intro to Web Dev
*Objective*: Build websites for people who want products/services on the web
## Types of Devs
**Front-end** - Work with presentation, user interface elements, user experience
- HTML, CSS, JS

**Back-end** - Work with databases, server side - ensuring that servers can store and serve the necessary data
- Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js

**Full stack** - does both
### Types of Career Paths
- Big Company - high compensation, well-established workflow, good resources and horizontal mobility. Highest barrier to entry
- Startups - High volatility, high highs and low lows, diff skill set from big company
- Freelancer - Have to market yourself and be enterprising - have your own people skills and be well-versed in finance to know how to turn a profit
- Consultant - more code, less hustle, lower possible income
- Old Company - Good balance and pay, often red tape and annoying bureaucracy, lots of maintaining old unmaintainable code bases, slower changes and movement within company
## Why Learning to Code Is Hard
Lots of entry level resources and hand-holding, but when it comes to crunch time and time to build things, you need to learn a lot more to construct something meaningful but now also have a lot less resources in order to do so - maybe resources like documentation on how to use tools, but less info on how to synthesize things to make something functional; people at this level also expect some level of competency so weak/stupid questions are responded to with vitriol which can be discouraging
- Important to set career goals and remember motivation
- Need to establish what you want to learn and how it connects back to your goals
# How to Learn

## Mindset
**Growth mindset** over a **fixed mindset** - believe that with enough grit and perseverance through failures that you can accomplish anything.
Embrace the struggle.
## Learning Process
1. Understand concept through lesson
2. Practice concept
3. Encounter problems
	1. Refresh fundamentals/go over lesson again
	2. Take a break
4. Teach concept - identify holes in your own knowledge

Two important modes of learning:
- **Focus Mode** where active learning occurs
- **Diffuse Mode** where subconscious synthesization occurs - during sleep, taking a break
The ideal work flow then involves the peaks of both - engage with content, attempt to solve a problem to practice content, take a break when stuck, reattempt from different approach/perspective.
## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Procrastinating
- Not taking breaks
- Digital and physical distractions
- Going down rabbit holes with diminishing returns
- Counter-productive note-taking

# Review Questions
## Asking Questions
> Describe the XY Problem

When someone is attempting to solve problem X, but believes that approach Y is the correct way to solve the problem. That person asks about how to do approach Y even though asking about/providing context about problem X is more productive because approach Y is not guaranteed to work.

> 5 things a well-formed technical question needs

1. Problem/Lesson
2. Pseudocode/code, error messages
3. Problem explanation
4. Expected behavior for solution
5. Summary of what you've tried so far and why they didn't work
